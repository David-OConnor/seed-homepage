# About

## Goals
- Learning the syntax, creating a project, and building it should be easy - regardless
of your familiarity with Rust.

- Complete documentation that always matches the current version. Getting examples working, and
 starting a project should be painless, and require nothing beyond this guide.
 
- Expressive, flexible vew syntax that's easy to read and write.


## A note on view syntax
This project uses an unconventional approach to describe how to display DOM elements.
It neither uses completely natural (ie macro-free) Rust code, nor
an HTML-like abstraction (eg JSX or templates). My intent is to make the code close 
to natural Rust, while streamlining the syntax in a way suited for creating 
a visual layout with minimal repetition. The macros used are thin wrappers
for constructors, and don't conceal much. Specifically, the element-creation macros
allow for accepting a variable number of parameters, and the attrs/style marcros are 
essentially HashMap literals, with wrappers that let element macros know how to distinguish
them.

The lack of resemblance to HTML be offputting, but the learning
curve is shallow, and I think the macro syntax is close-enough to normal Rust that it's 
easy to reason about how to build views, without compartmentalizing it into logic code and display code.
This lack of separation in particular is a controversial decision, but I think the benefits 
are worth it.


## Where to start if you're familiar with existing frontend frameworks
The [todomvc example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/seed/tree/master/examples/todomvc) is an implementation of the [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/),
which has example code in other frameworks that produce identitcal apps. Compare the example in this
project to one on that page that uses a framework you're familiar with.


## Influences
This project is strongly influenced by Elm, React, and Redux. The overall structure
of Seed apps mimicks that of The Elm Architecture.


## There are already several Rust/WASM frameworks; why add another?

 I'm distinguishing Seed through clear examples and documentation, and using `wasm-bindgen`/`web-sys` internally. I started this
project after being unable to get existing frameworks working
due to lack of documented examples, and inconsistency between documentation and 
published versions. My intent is for anyone who's proficient in a frontend
framework to get a standalone app working in the browser within a few minutes, using just the 
quickstart guide.

Seed's different approach to view syntax also distinguishes it: 
rather than use an HTML-like markup similar to JSX, 
it uses Rust builtin types, thinly-wrapped by macros that allow flexible composition.
This decision will not appeal to everyone, but I think it integrates more naturally with
the language.


## Why build a frontend in Rust over Elm, or Javascript-based frameworks?
You may prefer writing in Rust, and using packages from Cargo vice npm. Getting started with
this framework will in most cases be easier, and require less config and setup overhead than
with JS frameworks. You may appreciate Rust's compile-time error-checking, and built-in testing.

You may choose this approach over Elm if you're already comfortable with Rust,
or don't want to code business logic in a purely-functional langauge.

Compared with React, you may appreciate the consistency of how to write apps:
There's no distinction between logic and display code; no restrictions on comments;
no distinction between components and normal functions. The API is
flexible, and avoids OOP boilerplate. Its integrated routing and message system
avoids the dependency glue-code associated with Redux and React-Router.
