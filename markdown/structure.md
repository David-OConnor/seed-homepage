# App structure

## Model
Each app must contain a model [struct]( https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html), 
which contains the app’s state. It must should contain 
[owned data](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html). References
with a static [lifetime](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html) work,
but may be more difficult to work with. Example:

```rust
struct Model {
    count: i32,
    what_we_count: String
}

// Setup a default here, for initialization later.
impl Default for Model {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            count: 0,
            what_we_count: "click".into()
        }
    }
}
```
 
In this example, we initialize using Rust’s `Default` trait, in order to keep the initialization code by the
 model struct. When we call `Model.default()`, it initializes with these values. We could 
 also initialize it using a constructor method, or a struct literal. Note the use of `into()` 
 on our `&str` literal, to convert it into an owned `String`.
 
The model holds all data used by the app, and will be replaced with updated versions when the data changes.
Use owned data in the model; eg `String` instead of `&'static str`. The model may be split into sub-structs to organize it – 
this is especially useful as the app grows:
 
```rust
struct FormData {
    name: String,
    age: i8,
}

struct Misc {
    value: i8,
    descrip: String,
}

struct Model {
    form_data: FormData,
    misc: Misc
}
```

## Update
The Message is an [enum]( https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html) which 
categorizes each type of interaction with the app. It must implement `Clone`, and its 
fields may hold a value, or not.
We’ve abbreviated it as `Msg` here for brevity. If you're not familiar with enums,
think of one as a set of options; in other languages, you might use an integer, or string 
for this, but an enum is explicitly limited in which values it can take. Example:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
    ChangeDescrip(String),  //  We could use &'static str here too.
}
```
 
The update [function]( https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html) 
you pass to `seed::App::build(` describes how the state should change, upon
receiving each type of message. It's the only place where the model is changed. It accepts a message, 
and model as parameters, and returns an `Update` struct. `Update` contains `ShouldRender` and `Effect`
enums. `ShouldRender` and its variants are imported in the prelude, 
and has variants of 
`Render` and `Skip`. Render triggers a rendering update, and will be used in 
most cases. `Skip` updates the model without triggering a render, and is useful in animations.
`Effect` isn't exposed in the API: it's used internally to handle async events like
fetch requests. See the `Http requests` section for more info.

Example:
```rust
fn update(msg: Msg, model: &mut Model, _orders: &mut impl Orders<Msg>) {
    match msg {
        Msg::Increment => model.count += 1,
        Msg::SetCount(count) => model.count = count,
    }
}
```

While the signature of the update function is fixed, and will usually involve a 
match pattern with an arm for each message, there
are many ways you can structure this function. Some may be easier to write, and others may 
be more efficient, or appeal to specific aesthetics. While the example above
it straightforward, this becomes important with more complex updates.

More detailed example, from the 
[todoMVC example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/seed/tree/master/examples/todomvc):
```rust
fn update(msg: Msg, model: &mut Model, _orders: &mut impl Orders<Msg>) {
    match msg {
        Msg::ClearCompleted => {
            model.todos = model.todos.into_iter()
            .filter(|t| !t.completed)
            .collect();
        },
        Msg::Destroy(posit) => {
            model.todos.remove(posit);
        },
        Msg::Toggle(posit) => model.todos[posit].completed = !model.todos[posit].completed,
        Msg::ToggleAll => {
            let completed = model.active_count() != 0;
            for todo in &mut model.todos {
                todo.completed = completed;
            }
        }
}
```

The third parameter of the update function is an 
[Orders](https://docs.rs/seed/0.3.4/seed/prelude/struct.Orders.html)
 struct, imported in the prelude.
It has four methods, each defining an update behavior:

- `render`: Rerender the DOM, based on the new model. If `orders` is not used for a branch, it
is used.
- `skip`: Update the model without re-rendering
- `send_msg`: Update again, with a new message, the only parameter to this method
- `perform_cmd`: Perform an asynchronous task, like pulling data from a server. Its parameter
is a `Future`, ie `Future<Item = Ms, Error = Ms> + 'static`.

For an example of how to use orders, see the 
[orders example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/seed/blob/master/examples/orders/src/lib.rs).

As with the model, only one update function is passed to the app, but it may be split into 
sub-functions to aid code organization.


## View
 Visual layout (ie HTML/DOM elements) is described declaratively in Rust, and uses 
[macros]( https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-04-macros.html) to simplify syntax.

The view's defined by a function that's passed to `seed::run`. This takes a `Seed::app<Msg, Model>`, and Model
as parameters, and outputs something that implements the ` View` trait, which is imported in the prelude.
Usually, this is a `Node`, or `Vec<Node>`, representing all nodes that will be inserted as children
on the top-level one. (The top-level `Node` is in the html file, and specified with
`seed::App::build.mount()`, or as a default, the element with id `app`).
 It may composed into sub-functions, which can be thought of like components in other frameworks. 

Examples:
```rust
fn view(model: &Model) -> Node<Msg> {
    h1![ "Let there be light" ],
}
```

```rust
fn view(model: &Model) -> Vec<Node<Msg>> {
    vec![
        h1![ "Let there be light" ],
        h2![ "Let it be both a particle and a wave" ]
    ]
}
`````
In either of those examples, you could use the signature: `fn view(model: &Model) -> impl View<Msg>` instead.
This allows you to change between them without changing the function signature.

## The Node Enum
The Virtual DOM is represnted by nested [Nodes](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/enum.None.html).
THe node has 3 variants: 
- `Text` holds a [Text](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.Text.html)
struct. Mostly for internal use, but can be created with `Node::new_text()`.
- `Element` wraps an [El](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.El.html), which is
the main component of our VDOM. Created using macros, described below.
- `Empty` is a placeholder that doens't render anything; useful in conditional/ternary logic.
Created using the `empty![]` macro, or `seed::empty()`.


## Elements, attributes, styles
Elements are created using macros, named by the lowercase name of
each element, and imported into the global namespace. Eg `div!` above. We use this code to import them:
```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate seed;
```

These macros accept any combination of the following parameters:
- One [Attrs](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.Attrs.html) struct
- One [Style](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.Style.html) struct
- One or more [Listener](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.Listener.html) structs, which handle events
- One or more `Vec`s of `Listener` structs
- One `String` or `&str` representing a node text
- One or more [Node](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/enum.Node.html) structs, representing a child
- One or more Vecs of `Node` structs, representing multiple children
- A `Map`, ie the result of `map()`, yielding `Node`s or `Listener`s, without having to explicitly `collect`.

The parameters can be passed in any order; the compiler knows how to handle them
based on their types. Children are rendered in the order passed.

Views are described using [El](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.El.html) structs, 
defined in the [seed::dom_types](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/index.html) module.

`Attrs` and `Style` are thinly-wrapped hashmaps created with their own macros: `attrs!{}` and `style!{}`
respectively.

Example:
```rust
fn view(model: &Model) -> Node<Msg> {
    let things = vec![ h4![ "thing1" ], h4![ "thing2" ] ];
    
    let other_things = vec![1, 2];

    div![ attrs!{At::Class => "hardly-any"}, 
        things,  // Vec<Node<Msg>
        other_things.map(|t| h4![t.to_string()]),  // Map
        h4![ "thing3?" ],  // El
    ]
}
```
Note that you can create any of the above items inside an element macro, or create it separately,
and pass it in. You can separate different items by comma, semicolon, or space.

Keys passed to `attrs!` can be `Seed::At`s, `String`s, or `&str`s. 
Keys passed to `style!` can be `Seed::St`s, `String`s, or `&str`s.
Values passed to `attrs!`, and `style!` macros can 
be owned `Strings`, `&str`s, or for `style!`, `unit`s. 
Eg: `input![ attrs!{At::Disabled => false]` and `input![ attrs!{"disabled" => "false"]` 
are equivalent. You use the `unit!` macro to apply units. There's a `px` function for the
special case where the unit is pixels:
```rust
style!{St::Width => unit!(20, px);}
style!{St::Width => px(20);}  // equivalent
```

For boolean attributes that are handled by presense or absense, like `disabled`,
use can use `.as_at_value`: `input![ attrs!{At::Disabled => false.as_at_value() ]`

We can set multiple values for an attribute using `Attribute.add_multiple`. This
is useful for setting multiple classes. Note that we must set this up outside of
the view macro, since it involves modifying a variable:
```rust
fn a_component() -> Node<Msg> {
    let mut attributes = attrs!{};
    attributes.add_multiple(At::Class, vec!["A-modicum-of", "hardly-any"]);

    div![ attributes ]
}
```

Seed validates attributes [against this list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes);
The `At` enum includes only these values, and `&strs` passed are converted into `At`s. If you
wish to use a custom attribute, use `At::Custom(name)`, where `name` is a `String` of your
attribute's name. In `attrs!` when using `&str`s, inserting an unrecognized attribute
will do the same.

The `class!` and `id!` convenience macros allow settings
attributes as a list of classes, or a single id, if no other attributes are required.
Do not mix and match these with each other, or with attrs!; all but the last-passed
will be thrown out.
```rust
fn a_component() -> Node<Msg> {
    // ...
    span![ class!["calculus", "chemistry", "literature"] ],
    span![ id!("unique-element") ],
    // ...
}
```

You can conditionally add classes with the `class!` macro:
```rust
let active = true;

class![
    "blue",
    "highlighted" => active,
    "confusing" => 0.99999 == 1
    
]
```

Styles and Attrs can be passed as refs as well, which is useful if you need to pass
the same one more than once:
```rust
fn a_component() -> Node<Msg> {
    let item_style = style!{
        St::MarginTop => px(10);
        St::FontSize => unit!(1.2, em)
    };

    div![
        ul![
            li![ &item_style, "Item 1", ],
            li![ &item_style, "Item 2", ],
        ]
    ]
}
```

Setting an InputElement's `checked`, or `autofocus` property is done through normal attributes:
```rust
fn a_component() -> Node<Msg> {
    // ...
    input![ attrs!{At::Typed => "checkbox"; At::Checked => true} ]
    input![ attrs!{At::Autofocus => true} ]
    // ...
}
```

To change Attrs or Styles you've created, edit their .vals HashMap. To add
a new part to them, use their .add method:
```rust
let mut attributes = attrs!{};
attributes.add(At::Class, "truckloads");
```

Example of the style tag, and how you can use pattern-matching in views:
```rust
fn view(model: &Model) -> Node<Msg> {
    div![ style!{
        St:Display => "grid";
        St::GridTemplateColumns => "auto";
        St::GridTemplateRows => "100px auto 100px"
        },
        section![ style!{St::GridRow => "1 / 2"},
            header(),
        ],
        section![ attrs!{St::GridRow => "2 / 3"},
            match model.page {
                Page::Guide => guide(),
                Page::Changelog => changelog(),
            },
        ],
        section![ style!{St::GridRow => "3 / 4"},
            footer()
        ]
    ]
}
```

We can combine Attrs and Style instances using their `merge` methods, which take
an &Attrs and &Style respectively. This can be used to compose styles from reusable parts. 
Example:
```rust
fn a_component() -> Node<Msg> {
    let base_style = !style{"color" => "lavender"};

    div![
        h1![ &base_style.merge(&style!{St::GridRow => "1 / 2"}) "First row" ],
        h1![ &base_style.merge(&style!{St::GridRow => "2 / 3"}) "Second row" ],
    ]
}
```

Overall: we leverage of Rust's strict type system to flexibly-create the view
using normal Rust code.W


`El` has several helper methods which can be chained together:
```rust
let my_el = div![]
    .add_text("Words")
    .add_class("complete")
    .add_attr("alt".to_string(), "a description".to_string())
    .add_style(St::Height, "20px".to_string())
    .replace_text("Oops, not complete");oo

```

## Svg
You can create `SVG` elements in the same way as normal `Html` elements.
Setting the `xmlns` attribute isn't required; it's set automatically when using the macro.

Example using macros:
```rust
svg![
    rect![
        attrs!{
            At::X => "5",
            At::Y =>"5",
            At::Width => "20",
            At::Height => "20",
            At::Stroke => "green",
            At::StrokeWidth => "4",
        }
    ]
]
```

The same exmaple using `from_html`:
```rust
Node::from_html(
    "<svg>
      <rect x="5" y="5" width="20" height="20" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" />
    </svg>"
)
```

Another example, showing it in the `View` fn:
```rust
fn view(model: &Model) -> Vec<Node<Msg>> {
    vec![
        svg![
            attrs!{
                At::Width => "100%";
                At::Height => "100%";
                At::ViewBox => "0 0 512 512";
            },
            path![ 
                attrs!{
                    At::Fill => "lightgrey";
                    At::D => "M345.863,281.853c19.152-8.872,38.221-15.344,56.1"  // etc
                }
            ],
            // More elements as required, eg mesh, polyline, circle
        ]
    ]
}
```


## Initializing
To start your app, call the `seed::App::build` method, which takes the following parameters:

- An `init` function which accepts an initial routing, initial orders, and outputs an initial model
- Your update function
- Your view function

You can can chain the following optional methods:

- `.mount()` to mount in an element other than the one with id `app`.
- `.routes(routes)` to set a HashMap of landing-page routings, used to initialize your 
state based on url (See the `Routing` section)
- `.window_events(window_events)`, to set a function describing events on the `Window`. (See the `Events` section)

And must must complete with these methods: `.finish().run()`.

`.mount()` takes a single argument, which can be the id of the element you wish to mount in,
a `web_sys::Element`, or a `web_sys::HtmlElement`. Examples:
`seed::App::build(|_, _| Model::default(), update, view).mount(seed::body())`
`seed::App::build(|_, _| Model::default(), update, view).mount('a_div_id`)`

```
seed::App::build(|_, _| Model::default(), update, view).mount(
    seed::body().querySelector("section").unwrap().unwrap()
)
```

The `seed::App::build` call must be wrapped in a function with the `#[wasm_bindgen(start)]` invocation.

Example, with optional methods:
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn render() {
    seed::App::build(|_, _| Init::new(Model::default()), update, view)
        .mount("main")
        .routes(routes)
        .window_events(window_events)
        .finish()
        .run();
}
```

Example of using a standalone `init` function:
```rust
fn init(url: Url, orders: &mut impl Orders<Msg>) -> Init<Model> {
    Init::new(Model::default())
}

#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn render() {
    seed::App::build(init, update, view)
        .finish()
        .run();
}
```

This will render your app to the element holding the id you passed; in the case of this example,
"main". The only part of the web page Seed will interact with is that element, so you can
use other HTML not part of Seed, or other JS code/frameworks in the same document.
